# Features:
# - We can reward every top damager leaderboard position

# - We can have a conditions whereas the damager need minimal of (x) damage to receive the reward
# - We can give the damager a droptable from mythicmobs (using mythicmobs droptables system to give reward)
# - (create a suggestion if you have any)
